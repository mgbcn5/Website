        <p>My name is Meg and I am currently in my first year of UX Design. I am enrolled at SAIT where I am learning the basic principles of User Experience and design. So far, I have only worked on small projects and am hoping to keep learning more. In my spare time, I love designing clothes and am very passionate about it. I love experimenting with fabrics, styles, and clothes to create unique designs. Fashion is a great form of self-expression for me. I am also excited about venturing into game design soon! I want to combine my love for storytelling and aesthetics to create immersive experiences where players can explore their own styles and narratives. It's a fun challenge, and I can't wait to bring my ideas to life!</p>
